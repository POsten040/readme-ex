Usage

###Setup

Even though the following examples use import syntax, Lavaclient also supports CommonJS!

"ts
import { Cluster, Node } from "lavaclient";

const info = { host: "localhost", port: 2333, password: "youshallnotpass" };

const lavalink = new Node({
    connection: info,
    sendGatewayPayload: (id, payload) => sendWithDiscordLib(id, payload),
});

// or for clustering:

const lavalink = new Cluster({
    nodes: [ { id: "main", ...info } ],
    sendGatewayPayload: (id, payload) => sendWithDiscordLib(id, payload),
});

lavalink.connect("870267613635309618");
"

### Handling Voice Updates

Lavalink requires voice updates to play audio in a voice channel, this may vary from library to library.

What you need for correctly sending voice updates to lavalink:

 A connection to the Discord gateway.
 [**Raw** Voice _State_ and _Server_ updates](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#voice)
 Passing the data of the voice update to `(Cluster|Node)#handleVoiceUpdate`

[discord.js v13 example](https://github.com/lavaclient/djs-v13-example)

 Playing Music

"ts
const results = await lavalink.rest.loadTracks(
    "ytsearch:never gonna give you up",
);

await lavalink
    .createPlayer("830616783199010857")
    .connect("830638203739308053")
    .play(results.tracks[0]);
"

<sub>this is a very poor way of playing music btw... checkout our [discord.js example](https://github.com/lavaclient/djs-v13-example)</sub>
